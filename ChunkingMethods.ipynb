Metallurgical Laboratory physicists in Chicago designed nuclear reactors (\"piles\") that could transmute uranium into plutonium, while its chemists investigated ways to separate the plutonium from untransmuted uranium and fission products.[1] Approximately four tonnes of uranium was required to produce one kilogram of plutonium.[2] The plutonium program became known as the X-10 project.[3]', 'Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, Leslie Groves and Franklin Matthias at the Hanford Engineer Works in June 1945\\nOn 23 September 1942, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. became the director of the Manhattan Project.[4] Stone & Webster had been engaged to carry out the construction of the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but Groves considered the task of designing, building, and operating the Manhattan Project\\'s facilities to be beyond the resources of a single firm. At the same time, he wanted to keep the number of major contractors down for security reasons.[5]\\nGroves was attracted to DuPont, a firm he had worked with in the past, because it designed and built its own plants,[6] suggesting it had the expertise to act as prime contractor for the plutonium production complex. This had the added benefit of not requiring the Manhattan District (the military component of the Manhattan Project) to coordinate the work of contractors on the project, thereby reducing Groves\\'s workload.[5][7] Groves briefed DuPont vice president Willis F. Harrington and chemist Charles Stine on the Manhattan Project on 31 October.[8] They both protested that the company \"had no experience or knowledge of physics and that they were incompetent to render any opinion except that the entire project seemed beyond human capability.\"[9]\\nOn 4 November, DuPont chemists and engineers\\xa0– including Stine, Elmer Bolton, Roger Williams, Thomas H. Chilton and Crawford Greenewalt\\xa0– visited the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. On 10 November, Groves, Colonel Kenneth Nichols (the deputy chief engineer of the Manhattan District who was responsible for the HEW, the Clinton Engineer Works, and other production sites), Arthur H. Compton (the director of the Metallurgical Laboratory) and Norman Hilberry (Compton\\'s deputy) met with DuPont\\'s executive committee at the company headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. Groves assured DuPont\\'s president, Walter S. Carpenter Jr., that the Manhattan Project was considered of the greatest importance by President Franklin Roosevelt, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the United States Army George C. Marshall.[10][8]\\nMindful of having been denounced as a merchant of death after World War I, DuPont initially refused payment, but for legal reasons a cost-plus contract was agreed upon, with the fee of one dollar.[11] At Carpenter\\'s request, OSRD Director Vannevar Bush had Roosevelt initial a letter noting that the government assumed all responsibility for all hazards involved in the project.[12]', \"Site selection\\nMap of the Hanford Site\\nIt had originally been intended that the reactors be built at the Oak Ridge site, but Carpenter expressed reservations about this, because Oak Ridge was only 20 miles (32\\xa0km) from Knoxville.[13] Physicists at the Metallurgical Laboratory were more sanguine about the safety of nuclear reactors; Eugene Wigner claimed they could be built on the Potomac River near Washington, DC.[14] A major accident might result in loss of life and severe health effects, and Groves was concerned that even a minor one could disrupt vital war production\\xa0– particularly of aluminum\\xa0– or require evacuation of the Manhattan Project's isotope separation plants. But spreading the Oak Ridge facilities over a larger area would involve the purchase of more land. In December 1942, the number of reactors that needed to be built was still uncertain; for planning purposes it was intended to build six reactors and four chemical separation plants.[15]\\nThe ideal site was described by eight criteria:\"]\n",
