Task: Begin planning medium article. (outline) 

Topic of Discussion (Also potential titles): 
  * What is the Best Chunking Method for Your RAG chatbot? 
  * How to Find the Most Efficient Chunking Method
  * Chunking Methods and How to Find the Best One for You
  * How I Found the Right Chunking Method for my Project

1. Introduction

  What is my problem?: I don't know the best chunking method to use for my chatbot.
  What the objection of my research?: I want to learn more about the difference chunking methods and discover which one is best for my situation through testing and experimentation.

2. Background

  What is chunking? What is it's role in creating a chatbot/RAG? 

3. Methodology

  What documents you will I use and how will I collect them? Are they all the same format? Or is there a variety? 
  Explain each chunking method in detail.
  Define the metrics I will use to evaluate the chunking methods (e.g., coherence, processing time, accuracy).
  Describe how I will set up my experiment

4. Results

  Provide any additional experimental details. 
  Present the results of my experiments, including graphs and tables.
  Analyze the results to determine which chunking method performs best according to your defined metrics.

5. Discussion

  Interpret the results and discuss why certain chunking methods performed better than others.
  Discuss the implications of my findings for the development of the chatbot.

6. Conclusion

  Summarize the key findings of my research.

7. References

  Include all the references I cited in my paper.

Task: What is my methodology? How will I conduct my experiments? 

Step 1: What data will I be using to test the chunking methods? 

  The following pages have differening formats and will be used in the chatbot- 

    General Education Page: https://catalog.smu.edu/content.php?catoid=63&navoid=6039

    CS BS Page: https://catalog.smu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=63&poid=16504&returnto=6032

    Course Descriptions: https://catalog.smu.edu/content.php?         catoid=63&catoid=63&navoid=6034&filter%5Bitem_type%5D=3&filter%5Bonly_active%5D=1&filter%5B3%5D=1&filter%5Bcpage%5D=9#acalog_template_course_filter

Step 2: Which chunking methods will I be considering?

  * Fixed-Length Chunking 
  * Semantic Chunking 
  * Overlapping Chunking 

Step 3: What metrics will I being using to decide the best method? 

  First, we will test Sentence Boundary Coherence, Semantic Coherence, Context Preservation, and Processing Time on different chunk sizes
  Then, if possible, on the best performing methods, I'd like to test the precision and recall with a chatbot mockup

* Sentence Boundary Coherence: Count the number of complete sentences within each chunk.
* Semantic Coherence: Use methods like BERTScore, which measures the semantic similarity between chunks and reference texts using contextual embeddings from models like BERTâ€‹
* Context Preservation: Assess how well chunks retain important context, using metrics like token overlap and context retention scores.
* Processing Time: Measures the time taken to process and chunk the text.
* Precision and Recall: Measure how accurately the chunks reflect the necessary information for degree planning queries.
