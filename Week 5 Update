Chunking Methods for LLMs:

Chunking: chunking refers to the process of breaking down long texts into smaller, manageable pieces or "chunks."

Why do we use chunking in the context of large language models?
  1. Memory and Computational Constraints: LLMs, like GPT-3 or GPT-4, have a maximum token limit they can process at once. For instance, if the limit is 4096 tokens, any text longer than that needs to be chunked to fit within this constraint.
  2. Improving Performance: Smaller chunks can improve the model's performance by reducing the complexity and potential for errors in understanding and generating responses.
  3. Context Management: By chunking text, it's easier to manage and maintain context across interactions.

Different Types of Chunking Methods: 
  1. Fixed-Length Chunking: This method involves breaking the text into chunks of a predetermined size, typically measured in tokens.
  2. Semantic Chunking: This method divides the text based on natural breaks, such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections.
  3. Overlapping Chunking: Each chunk includes some overlap with the previous one to maintain context and coherence.
  4. Sentence-Level Chunking: This method splits text into chunks based on sentences, ensuring each chunk contains whole sentences.
  5. Hybrid Chunking: Combines elements of different chunking methods to balance their advantages.
  6. Context-Aware Chunking: Uses semantic and contextual information to determine the best chunk boundaries, ensuring that chunks maintain the flow of meaning and coherence.
  7. Dynamic Chunking: Adjusts chunk sizes and boundaries on-the-fly based on the content and the specific requirements of the task.

Task: Use Beautiful Soup to scrape a webpage, and practice different chunking methods on that webpage data

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Step 1: Scrape the Webpage
url = 'https://www.example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    text_content = soup.get_text()
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve the webpage. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    text_content = ""

# Step 2: Implement Chunking Methods

# Fixed-Length Chunking
def fixed_length_chunking(text, chunk_size):
    return [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]

# Semantic Chunking
def semantic_chunking(text):
    paragraphs = text.split('\n\n')
    return paragraphs

# Overlapping Chunking
def overlapping_chunking(text, chunk_size, overlap):
    return [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size - overlap)]

# Example usage of chunking methods
if text_content:
    fixed_chunks = fixed_length_chunking(text_content, 200)
    semantic_chunks = semantic_chunking(text_content)
    overlapping_chunks = overlapping_chunking(text_content, 200, 50)
    
    # Print the first 3 chunks of each method
    print(f"Fixed-Length Chunks: {fixed_chunks[:3]}")
    print(f"Semantic Chunks: {semantic_chunks[:3]}")
    print(f"Overlapping Chunks: {overlapping_chunks[:3]}")

How do you decide the best chunk size? 
  Some things to consider include...
  1. Token Limit: Most LLMs have a maximum token limit (e.g., 2048 tokens for GPT-3, 4096 tokens for GPT-4). Ensure your chunk size stays within this limit. 
  2. Memory and Performance: Larger chunks require more memory and computational resources. Balance chunk size with available resources.
  3. Coherence: Choose a chunk size that maintains the coherence and context of the text. Avoid splitting sentences or paragraphs awkwardly.
  4. Complexity: For complex or technical texts, smaller chunks may help the model better understand and process the information.
  5. Task Specificity: Different tasks may benefit from different chunk sizes. For instance, summarization might require larger chunks to capture enough context, while question answering might work better with smaller chunks.
  6. Performance vs. Accuracy: Smaller chunks may lead to higher accuracy by reducing context loss but can increase processing time. Larger chunks might speed up processing but risk losing context.

Task: Determine the best chunk size for a text summarization

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Step 1: Scrape the Webpage
url = 'https://www.example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    text_content = soup.get_text()
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve the webpage. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    text_content = ""

# Step 2: Define Chunking Methods
def fixed_length_chunking(text, chunk_size):
    return [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]

# Step 3: Experiment with Different Chunk Sizes
chunk_sizes = [256, 512, 1024, 2048]
results = {}

for size in chunk_sizes:
    chunks = fixed_length_chunking(text_content, size)
    # Perform the task (e.g., summarization) on each chunk and evaluate
    # For simplicity, we'll just store the number of chunks here
    results[size] = len(chunks)

# Step 4: Evaluate Results
for size, count in results.items():
    print(f"Chunk Size: {size}, Number of Chunks: {count}")

# This example focuses on chunk count; in practice, evaluate task-specific metrics
